create a  client.ovpn file to connect with openvpn in aws

Log in to your OpenVPN server instance in AWS using SSH.

Install the easy-rsa package by running the following command:

sudo yum install -y easy-rsa

Create a directory to hold your client configuration files by running the following command:

sudo mkdir /etc/openvpn/client-configs

Create a base client configuration file by running the following command:

sudo cp /etc/openvpn/sample-config-files/client.conf /etc/openvpn/client-configs/base.conf

Edit the base client configuration file to match your requirements by running the following command:

sudo nano /etc/openvpn/client-configs/base.conf

Here are some configuration options you may want to modify:

remote: The IP address or domain name of your OpenVPN server.
port: The port number on which your OpenVPN server is listening.
proto: The protocol used by your OpenVPN server, usually udp or tcp.
dev: The name of the TUN/TAP network interface to be used by the client. This should match the dev option in your server configuration file.
ca, cert, and key: The file names of the server's certificate authority, client certificate, and client key files, respectively. These files will be created in the next steps.
Generate a client certificate and key by running the following commands:

bash
Copy code
cd /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/
sudo ./easyrsa build-client-full CLIENTNAME nopass
Replace CLIENTNAME with a unique name for your client.

Create a directory to hold the client certificate and key by running the following command:

sudo mkdir /etc/openvpn/client-configs/keys

Copy the client certificate and key to the client-configs directory by running the following command:

sudo cp /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/pki/issued/CLIENTNAME.crt /etc/openvpn/client-configs/keys/

sudo cp /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/pki/private/CLIENTNAME.key /etc/openvpn/client-configs/keys/

Copy the CA certificate to the client-configs directory by running the following command:

sudo cp /etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/pki/ca.crt /etc/openvpn/client-configs/keys/

Create a client.ovpn file by running the following command:

sudo nano /etc/openvpn/client-configs/CLIENTNAME.ovpn

Replace CLIENTNAME with the same name you used in step 6.

Copy the contents of the base client configuration file and paste them into the client.ovpn file.

Add the following lines to the end of the client.ovpn file:

vbnet
Copy code
<ca>
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
[Contents of ca.crt file]
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
</ca>

<cert>
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
[Contents of CLIENTNAME.crt file]
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
</cert>

<key>
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
[Contents of CLIENTNAME.key file]
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
</key>
Replace [Contents of ca.crt file], [Contents of CLIENTNAME.crt file], and [Contents of CLIENTNAME.key file] with the actual contents of the files you copied in steps 8-9.

Save and close the client.ovpn file.

That's
